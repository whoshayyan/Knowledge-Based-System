# Cancer Detection Knowledge-Based System with WH Questions

## Overview

This project involves the development of a knowledge-based system for cancer detection using WH (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) questions. The system interacts with patients through a series of questions to gather information about their symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle factors. Based on the responses provided by the patient, the system calculates the probability of the patient having cancer and provides appropriate recommendations or referrals for further medical evaluation.

## Features

- **WH Questions**: Utilizes a set of predefined WH questions to systematically gather relevant information from patients.
- **Probabilistic Assessment**: Calculates the probability of cancer based on the collected information and known risk factors.
- **Multi-Step Inquiry**: Conducts multiple rounds of questioning to delve deeper into specific areas of concern or uncertainty.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides personalized recommendations based on the calculated probability, such as lifestyle changes, screening tests, or referral to healthcare professionals.
- **User Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for patients to interact with the system and input their responses to the questions.

## Components

- **Question Repository**: Contains a library of WH questions categorized according to relevant domains, such as symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.
- **Inference Engine**: Implements the logic for processing patient responses, updating probability estimates, and generating recommendations.
- **Probability Model**: Defines the probabilistic model used to calculate the likelihood of cancer based on input variables and risk factors.
- **User Interface Module**: Provides an interface for patients to input their responses to the questions and receive feedback from the system.
- **Database Integration**: Optionally integrates with patient databases or electronic health records to access additional information for inference.

## Operation

1. **Patient Interaction**: The system prompts the patient with a series of WH questions related to their health status, symptoms, and relevant factors.
2. **Data Collection**: Patient responses are collected and processed by the system to update the probability estimate of cancer.
3. **Probability Calculation**: Using the collected data and predefined probability models, the system calculates the likelihood of cancer.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on the calculated probability, the system provides personalized recommendations to the patient, such as lifestyle changes, screening tests, or referrals to healthcare professionals.
5. **Feedback Loop**: The system may engage in a feedback loop, asking follow-up questions or requesting additional information to refine the probability estimate and recommendations further.

## Future Enhancements

- **Natural Language Processing**: Implement natural language processing techniques to allow for more flexible and conversational interactions with patients.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the accuracy of the probability estimates and recommendations based on collected data.
- **Integration with Medical Devices**: Integrate with wearable devices or home monitoring systems to access real-time health data for more accurate assessments.
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Develop algorithms for personalized risk assessment based on individual patient characteristics, genetic factors, and environmental exposures.

## Usage

To utilize this knowledge-based system for cancer detection:

1. Set up the system environment and dependencies.
2. Configure the system parameters, including the question repository.
3. Deploy the system for patient interaction, ensuring proper data privacy and security measures are in place.
4. Collect patient responses to the WH questions and monitor system performance and accuracy over time.
5. Continuously update and refine the system based on feedback and new research findings to enhance its effectiveness in cancer detection and risk assessment.
